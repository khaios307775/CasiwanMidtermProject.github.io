    <div id="infobox"> <p>&emsp; &ensp; Hi! I am John Paul Casiwan, though you can call me JP for short. Thank you for taking interest in checking my website. I started coding during the pandemic due to boredom, mainly in python and just coding simple games and learning the language. Aside from programming, I enjoy subjects of math and science as well as making art and designing. As of now, I am learning to implement arts and designs into making websites and this is one of the official sites I have worked on, so pay no mind to the aesthetics of the site.</p><br>
