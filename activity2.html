<!--About me is here -->
	<p style="text-align:left;">&emsp;&emsp;I am John Paul Casiwan, an 18 year old BSCS student here in Silliman University. 
	I graduated high school from DMC College Foundation in Dipolog city, Zamboanga del Norte.
	Although I lived there for 10 years of my life, I am from Samar for 2 years and Baguio city
	during my childhood years and originally being born in Pasig city, Metro Manila. So, technically
	I had visited all 3 regions of the Philippines. I do not like to study and would do anything to 
	prevent that but I enjoy problem solving and fixing things.</p>
	<p style="text-align:left;">&emsp;&emsp;In my free time, I play sports like volleyball, badminton, basketball and chess but I also
	like to play e-games like Mobile Legends, Call of Duty or Minecraft. Although despising any forms of 
	studying, I like to solve math equations involving physics and quantum physics. I also know, arguably 
	a lot about biology, especially immunology. My friends and family also tell me I may have chosen the wrong 
	course, but I myself could not decide which course to take, and I foresee that technology may have a greater
	impact in this generation, hence I would like to play my part.</p><hr>

<!--Here are my goals-->	
	<h2>My Goals</h2>
	<p style="text-align:left;">&emsp;&emsp;My main goal is to survive anything without much effort. Although it sounds highly unlikely, I like to 
	do everything in college without putting much effort during tasks and quietly without showing too much. My main goal in my life is to learn everything I can during
	my school years and use the knowledge I acquired to contribute something such as in the medical or in the technological
	my school years and use the knowledge I acquired to contribute something such as in the medical or in the technological
	field. Aside from that my side goals are to reach the high level in chess and my other sports.</p>
